#Energy Consumption Prediction:


Problem Statement: 
Energy consumption is a crucial factor in optimizing resource usage, reducing costs, and improving sustainability. 
However, fluctuations in energy demand make it challenging to plan and allocate resources efficiently. This project aims to develop a machine
learning model that predicts energy consumption based on various factors such as temperature, humidity, power usage, and other relevant features. 
The goal is to enable better energy management and decision-making for businesses and households.

Key Objectives:
✅ Analyze Energy Consumption Patterns
✅ Develop Predictive Models
✅ Evaluate Model Performance
✅ Optimize and Improve the Model
